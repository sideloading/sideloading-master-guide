## Enterprise Certificates

Applications downloaded using Enterprise Certificates can be revoked randomly.

The following sites all use Enterprise Certificates to sign apps to your device for free.

* [appdb](https://appdb.to/) (allows you to easily reinstall all revoked apps with one button from [IPA Cache](https://appdb.to/my/ipa-cache))
* [Tweakbox](https://www.tweakboxapp.com/)
