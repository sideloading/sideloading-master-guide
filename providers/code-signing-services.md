# Code Signing Services \[Paid]

{% hint style="warning" %}
New limitations by Apple in early May 2022 has introduced delays with activation/provisioning of developer profiles to devices. You may purchase from third party code-signing services but **may be delayed for up to 33-days** to be activated with the service.

Alongside this, Apple has been aggressively revoking services over-provisioning developer certificates.

It is recommended to supply your own Apple Developer Certificate rather than rely on a third party.
